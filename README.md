# 🏥 Insurance Claims & Policy Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze insurance claims and policy performance across multiple dimensions. The dashboard provides a clear overview of claim statuses, premium performance, customer segmentation, and policy activity.  
It is built entirely using **CSV data**, with all data preparation and corrections handled in **Microsoft Excel** (cleaning, standardization, missing value handling), followed by visualization in Power BI.
## 📊 **Dashboard Overview**

The report provides actionable insights into:

- Claim trends across policy types  
- Distribution of active vs inactive policies  
- Premium and claim amounts across customer age groups  
- Claim status breakdowns (Rejected, Settled, Pending)  
- Total premium, coverage, and claim amount KPIs  
- Detailed table showing settlement performance by policy type  

These insights help insurance companies monitor performance, identify risk areas, and optimize operational decision-making.

## 🧹 **Data Preparation (Excel)**

Before the data was imported into Power BI, the following steps were performed in **Excel**:

- Standardized column names  
- Corrected inconsistent data formatting  
- Removed duplicates  
- Normalized policy categories  
- Cleaned missing or incomplete entries  
- Verified total amounts and numeric columns  

No DAX measures were used — the report relies on:

- Excel-cleaned data  
- Power BI default aggregations  
- Slicers and filters for interaction  

## 🛠 **Skills Demonstrated**

## 🔍 **Key Insights**

- Travel and Health policies contribute the highest premium amounts  
- Majority of policies are **inactive**, indicating potential customer churn  
- Claim settlement trends vary significantly across policy categories  
- Senior customers have higher claim amounts than younger groups  
- A clear imbalance between settled and pending claims suggests operational bottlenecks

## ▶ **How to Use**

1. Download the `.pbix` file  
2. Open it in **Power BI Desktop**  
3. Use slicers (Policy Number, Claim Number, Customer ID) to interact  
4. Explore KPI cards, visuals, and detailed policy table
